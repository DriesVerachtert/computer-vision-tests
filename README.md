= Computer vision tests

In the course of more than 3 decades, me and my girlfriend amassed almost 2 terabyte of photos. Quite some of the photos have metadata, but definitely not all of them.

The goal of these python programs: test some computer vision related libraries to extract information such as who or what is depicted on each photo.


== Test data

* Photo of Carolien, scaled down, face clearly visible
* Another photo of Carolien, scaled down, face clearly visible, made shortly after the first photo
* Photo of Carolien with a child, both faces clearly visible
